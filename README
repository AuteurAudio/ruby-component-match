                A Ruby Component Value Matcher
		------------------------------


Overview:	Matches components on a single measured
		axis that is orderable (float).  Input can 
		be programatic via array or by way of CSV
		with column number specified.  Results can
		be computed and returned in absolute terms
		or in percentage terms.  Prints a report 
		but can be modified to not.

Method:		Iterative passes taking best adjacent pairing
		in forward and reverse sweeps until there are
		no more potential pairs meeting tolerance
		criteria. 

Examples:	Match 1st column of CSV to 0.3%:
		  ComponentMatch.new('some.csv')
				.match(0.3)

		Match array to 2%:
		  ComponentMatch.new([1,2,3])
				.match(2)
		
		Match 3rd column of CSV to 0.3 units:
		  ComponentMatch.new('some.csv',2)
			        .match(0.3,'absolute')
